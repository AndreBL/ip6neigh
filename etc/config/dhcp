# Example sections to be put in /etc/config/dhcp for generating
# predefined SLAAC addresses and naming them with ip6neigh script.
#
# DO NOT overwrite your OpenWrt dhcp config file with this one. Use the
# examples to edit your current configuration. IPv4 options are not shown
# in the examples. You may want to keep your current IPv4 settings. Do not
# remove them just because they are not shown in the examples.
#
# New options for host sections:
# slaac		0=disabled, 1=enabled with EUI-64 IID, other value means
#			"use this custom IID". Use a single leading ':' if the IID
#			starts with zeros. See the example configs below.
# ll_iid	Override slaac IID for link-local address
# ula_iid	Override slaac IID for ULA address
# gua_iid	Override slaac IID for GUA address
# perm		Adds the host to the neighbors table with NUD state permanent.
#			Will also apply to the host's DHCP IPv4 address.
#			0=disabled, 1=enabled for predefined addresses, 2=enabled for
#			predefined and any discovered addresses associated with this MAC.
	

# Devices that use EUI-64 interface identifiers (IIDs) for all scopes:
config host
	option name		'Android-John'
	#Copy the MAC address of the device.
	option mac		'1a:41:8e:83:66:74'
	option slaac	'1'


# Windows machines or other hosts that do not use EUI-64 IIDs but
# use other static IIDs instead:
config host
	option name		'Laptop-Paul'
	#Copy the MAC address of the device.
	option mac		'2e:36:e7:85:d3:3b'
	#Copy the interface identifier from the link-local address of
	#of the device.
	option slaac	'daa1:4554:747b:1f50'

# Creates IPv6 broadcast-like addresses for routing Wake-on-LAN packets from

# Workaround solution for crappy Android 5 (Lollipop) devices that are known to
