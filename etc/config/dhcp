# Example sections to be put in /etc/config/dhcp for generating
# predefined SLAAC addresses and naming them with ip6neigh script.
#
# DO NOT overwrite your OpenWrt dhcp config file with this one. Use the
# examples to edit your current configuration. IPv4 options are not shown
# in the examples. You may want to keep your current IPv4 settings. Do not
# remove them just because they are not shown in the examples.
#
# New options for host sections:
# slaac		0=disabled, 1=enabled with standard EUI-64 IID. Other value means
#			"use this custom IID". See the example configs below.
# lla_iid	Override 'slaac' IID for link-local address
# ula_iid	Override 'slaac' IID for ULA address
# wula_iid	Override 'slaac' IID for WULA address
# gua_iid	Override 'slaac' IID for GUA address
# perm		Adds the host to the neighbors table with NUD state permanent.
#			Will also apply to the host's DHCP IPv4 address.
#			0=disabled, 1=enabled for predefined addresses, 2=enabled for
#			predefined and any discovered addresses associated with this MAC.
# iface		Configure to which interface the host is connected.
#			This will ensure that only the correct prefix will be used.
	

# Example 1: Devices that use standard EUI-64 interface identifiers (IIDs)
# for all scopes:
config host
	option name		'Android-John'
	#Copy the MAC address of the device.
	option mac		'1a:41:8e:83:66:74'
	option slaac	'1'
	option iface	'lan'


# Example 2: Windows machines or other hosts that do not use EUI-64 IIDs, but
# use other static IIDs instead:
config host
	option name		'Laptop-Paul'
	#Copy the MAC address of the device.
	option mac		'2e:36:e7:85:d3:3b'
	#Copy the interface identifier from the link-local address of
	#of the device.
	option slaac	'daa1:4554:747b:1f50'
	option iface	'lan'

# Example 3: Creates IPv6 broadcast-like addresses for routing Wake-on-LAN
# packets from the internet to the LAN network over IPv6. Needs proper firewall
# rules to secure against possible attacks. Use with caution.
config host
	option name		'WoL'
	#Layer 2 broadcast address. Leave it as it is.
	option mac		'ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff'
	#This may be changed to a custom interface identifier.
	option slaac	'feed:feed:feed:feed'
	option perm		'1'
	option iface	'lan'
#Firewall rules to be put in /etc/firewall.user for the above example, using UDP port 9 to
#forward WoL packets from the internet to LAN interface br-lan:
#ip6tables -N wol_forwarding
#ip6tables -A wol_forwarding -p udp --dport 9 -m limit --limit 10/sec --limit-burst 30 -j ACCEPT
#ip6tables -A wol_forwarding -j DROP
#ip6tables -A forwarding_wan_rule -o br-lan -d 2000::feed:feed:feed:feed/e000::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff -j wol_forwarding

# Example 4: Workaround solution for crappy Android 5 (Lollipop) devices that
# are known to have a bug in their NDP protocol that slows down the web browser
# response in dual-stack WiFi networks. This is experimental.
config host
	option name		'Lollipop'
	#Copy the MAC address of the device.
	option mac		'4a:b9:b0:09:10:8b'
	option slaac	'1'
	option perm		'2'
	option iface	'lan'
