# UCI example configuration file for ip6neigh script
# Default values will be assumed for options that are left undefined/commented out.

config ip6neigh 'config'

	# LAN interface logical name. Default: 'lan'
	#option lan_iface	'lan'
	
	# IPv6 WAN interface logical name. Default: 'wan6'
	#option wan_iface	'wan6'
	
	# Wipe global addresses from LAN interface when WAN goes down. Should be
	# enabled if the ISP does prefix delegation with dynamic prefix.
	# 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default: '0'
	#option lan_wipe		'1'
	
	# Top-level domain name for local hosts. Will load the option domain from
	# /etc/config/dhcp if not specified here. Default: 'lan'
	#option domain		'lan'
	
	# Name to be given to the router's IPv6 addresses. Corresponding labels will
	# be appended for each scope of address. Use '0' if you want to disable this
	# feature. Default: 'Router'
	#option router_name	'0'
	
	# Enable Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) snooping feature. Requires package
	# tcpdump. If enabled, ip6neigh will instantly detect when a new host joins the
	# network and will be able to see all the IPv6 addresses took by that host.
	# Using this feature is highly recommended if you have more than 32 MB of RAM
	# and enough flash space to install tcpdump.
	# 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default: '0'
	#option dad_snoop	'1'

	# When a new address is discovered, auto probe for other addresses based
	# on the neighbor's MAC address.
	# 0=disabled, 1=all scopes, 2=same scope. Default: '1'
	#option probe_eui64	'0'

	# When a new address is discovered, auto probe for other addresses with
	# the same interface identifier but with different prefixes. 
	# 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default: '1'
	#option probe_iid	'0'
	
	# When a new address is discovered, probe any other addresses that belong
	# to that same host to update their reachability status. 
	# 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default: '1'
	#option probe_host	'0'

	# Custom label for link-local addresses. Writing '0' clears the label.
	# Default: 'LL'
	#option ll_label	'0'

	# Label for LAN unique local addresses (ULA). Writing '0' clears the label.
	# Default is no label for ULAs.
	#option ula_label	'ULA'
	
	# Label for unique local addresses (ULA) inherited from the WAN network.
	# Writing '0' clears the label. Defaults to 'ULA' if the network has ULA
	# prefix and no label if the network does not have ULA prefix.
	#option wula_label	'0'

	# Label for globally unique addresses (GUA). Writing '0' clears the label.
	# Defaults to 'PUB' if the network has ULA or WULA prefix and no label if the
	# network does not have neither ULA nor WULA prefix.
	#option gua_label	'0'
	
	# This label will be applied to addresses with prefix that does not match
	# either the link-local prefix or the ULA/WULA/GUA prefix of the router's LAN
	# interface. Writing '0' clears the label. If the label is cleared, any address
	# starting with 'fd' will be considered as ULA and any other global address will
	# be considered as GUA (WULA distinction will also be disabled).
	# Default: 'UNROUTED'
	#option unrouted_label	'UNROUTED'

	# Secondary label for temporary (RFC 4941) address. Will also be applied
	# to addresses with Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers (RFC 7217).
	# Writing '0' clears the label.
	# Default: 'TMP'
	#option tmp_label	'0'
	
	# Secondary label for managed address. Will be applied to any addresses with IID
	# that match '0:0:0:*'. Writing '0' clears the label.
	# Default: 'MAN'
	#option man_label	'0'

	# Get names from DHCPv6 leases. 0=disabled, 1=enabled.
	# Default: '1'
	#option dhcpv6_names	'0'
	
	# Get names from DHCPv4 leases. 0=disabled, 1=enabled.
	# Default: '1'
	#option dhcpv4_names	'0'
	
	# Generate names based on the manufacturer of the device if DHCPv6/v4 names
	# were not available. 0=disabled, 1=enabled.
	# Default: '1'
	#option manuf_names	'0'

	# Enable loading of predefined static or MAC-based IIDs from /etc/config/dhcp.
	# 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default: '1'
	#option load_static	'0'
	
	# Flush the neighbors table on startup. Add together the values corresponding
	# to each NUD status.
	# 1=PERMANENT, 2=STALE, 4=REACHABLE
	# Example: Flush PERMANENT and STALE neighbors on startup: option flush '3'
	# Default: '1'
	#option flush	'1'
	
	# List of user firewall script files. If defined, ip6neigh will call these
	# scripts upon start, after populating the hosts file with predefined hosts
	# from /etc/config/dhcp. Useful for creating firewall rules for global addresses
	# with dynamic prefix. The environmental variables passed to the script are:
	# DOMAIN LAN_DEV WAN_DEV ULA_ADDR ULA_PREFIX GUA_ADDR GUA_PREFIX
	#list fw_script		'/root/file_server.sh'
	#list fw_script		'/root/other_server.sh'

	# Enable logging of debug messages. Options are '0' for disabled,
	# '1' to use syslog or 'file name' if you want to log to a file instead.
	# Default: '0'
	option log		'/tmp/log/ip6neigh.log'
